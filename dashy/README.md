This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.32.3.

## tooling
The usage of [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is recommended to switch between different versions of node when necessary.
For Microsoft Windows based development [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) can be used. 
The currently used node version can be determined by taking a look the machine section of [circle.yml](https://github.com/reflectoring/infiniboard/blob/master/circle.yml).
